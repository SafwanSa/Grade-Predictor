# Grade-Predictor
A simple program that uses machine learning to predict the final exam grade

A program that predicts the final exam grades of a student giving their exam1 grade, exam2 grade, class work, discussion marks, and the number of absences.
Using Machine Learning (Linear Regression algorithm) and COE202 course's data, I have accomplished an accuracy of the predictions to be around 85%.
The model needs more data. So, after I collect more data, I am going to improve the model.
